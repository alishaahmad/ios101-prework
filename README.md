F1 Pulse is an app that is designed for new and casual Formula 1 fans who want a simplified and engaging way to stay updated during race weekends. The app would feature a clean race calendar, live race countdowns, and quick summaries of drivers, teams, and recent results. I’d like to include a "Race Mode" that activates during Grand Prix weekends, showing live standings, pit stop updates, and fun facts in real time. A beginner mode would explain terms like DRS, undercut, and safety car in simple language. The goal is to make F1 more approachable, exciting, and easy to follow — especially for fans who feel overwhelmed by complex stats or broadcasts.
